    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> February 02, 2026</p>
    <p><strong>Developer:</strong> CodePump</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how FullDownloader ("we", "our", or "the App") collects, uses, and protects your information. By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Third-Party Login and Cookie Usage (X / Pixiv)</h2>

    <p>When you log in via the WebView:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Direct Connection:</strong> You are logging in directly to the official websites of X or Pixiv. The App acts as a browser.</li>

        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> These Cookies are used strictly to authenticate your requests to fetch your bookmarked/liked media lists for downloading purposes.</li>

    <h2>3. Storage Permissions</h2>
